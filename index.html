  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>World of Coders is a community for coders, however, it is not open, applications are going to be opening soon, you could also directly DM void (the owner) with your application.
We're aimed at having fun while coding, but we expect certain qualities and traits that come out of your behalf: use your common sense.<p>
