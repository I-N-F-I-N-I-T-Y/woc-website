# Rights & Use
You may distribute the source but not claim rights to the website. I am fine with you using it, as long as you provide credit, optionally, you could provide a link to the GitHub page, but if you don't want to do that then leaving the names of the creator(s) is fine.

We cannot guarantee that by the time you decide to experiment with the code, it'll be broken. If it is broken, you mustn't hold us liable,
this is already covered in the license we're using (MIT) but I'd like to get the message out because of how important it is.
